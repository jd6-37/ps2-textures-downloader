## Features <a name="features"></a>

The NCAA NEXT mod requires a massive folder of replacement textures. This app helps manage the installation and upkeep of those textures. It is, essentially, three utilities in one:

1. An INSTALLER for the first-time download and setup of the textures pack
2. An UPDATER - a download/sync tool for post-installation updates of the textures pack
3. A HEALTH CHEKER - checks for stray/duplicate-named files and compares directory structure to github

### MOD INSTALLER <a name="introduction--installer"></a>

The **installer** ("First Time Setup") breaks up the 12+ GBs (and growing) of files into multiple smaller zip files and downloads them individually (and automatically extracts them). If you download the source.zip directly from Github, it will come as a single massive zip file, which can cause issues of failed downloads and corrupted archives. Additionally, the installer will also put the textures in the proper location (after you point it to your emualator's textures folder - Eg. C:\PCSX2\textures).

### MOD UPDATER <a name="introduction--updater"></a>

The **updater's "Download New Content"** sync allows for quickly grabbing the latest changes or additions to the project that have been published to Github. It is better than downloading a zip file of updates because A) it only downloads what you don't have (or don't have the latest version of), B) it's able to move/rename files instead of downloading them, and C) it's able to delete files that have been deleted from the project – something a zip download can never do. It does all of this by means of the Github API and is able to, essentially, follow along with the changes the team makes to the project. Also, it uses the same file hashing comparison that Git/Github uses to know if your local file is the same as the one in Github. This is much more accurate than other methods such as comparing modified dates. 

The **updater's "Full Sync"** sync does the same as above, but instead of looking at changes (Git commits) since your last sync date, it looks at the entire history of changes.

### MOD HEALTH CHECKER <a name="introduction--healthcheck"></a>

After every sync, the app will automatically run a **health check** to identify potential stray files in the textures directory that may be causing issues. With PS2 texture replacement, no two files can have the same name anywhere across the the entire `replacements` folder or any of its subfolders. The file *names* are all that matter to the emulator. The emulator will use the first "file.png" it finds, and will ignore the rest of the files with that name. To help prevent that issue, the health check compares the directory tree of the local installation versus that of the Github repository. If it finds any files/paths that exist locally but not in Github, it will offer to delete them. This health check combined with the 'Full Sync' will ensure your local textures are perfectly in sync with the project's latest version and that there are no extraneous files that could cause issues.

## How it Handles User-Custom Textures <a name="custom-textures"></a>

One great thing about PS2 modding is that it's very easy for users to customize the textures for their own installation. For example, in the NCAA NEXT mod, a user can use the ESPN logo in the scorebug instead of the mod's default NCAA NEXT logo, or they can use a different helmet texture for their favorite team's home uniform. These changes are easy to make and only require the user puts the desired new texture into the `replacements` folder and rename or remove the mod's default replacement texture (because remember, no two textures can have the same name).

This app was built with this in mind! It has two special features that make it great for modders:

1. It completely ignores anything in the `user-customs` folder. Put all of your custom textures and/or DLC in this folder. The updater tool will never try to update or delete them.

2. It recognizes disabled textures (filenames prepended with a dash "-", Eg. `-file.png`) and won't try to download them again. It will even update the disabled/prepended file to the latest version!

**IMPORTANT**: To utilize these features you must A) **put all of your custom and DLC textures in the `user-customs` folder** (putting it anywhere else will result in it being deleted or changed to the mod default) and B) for every default mod texture for which you have a custom texture, **leave the default texture in place** (don't remove or move it) **AND prepend the filename name with a dash** to disable it. Eg. if it was named `3a30272f374c5d47.png`, change the name to `-3a30272f374c5d47.png`. Now, because it is not the specific filename that the emulator is looking for, it's disabled; it doesn't exist as far as the emulator can tell. However, the updater tools still knows exactly what it is!

## Installing the App <a name="installation"></a>

To install and run the app, you have two options:

### Install Option 1: Windows Installer <a name="installation--exe"></a>

*This option is for forked repos that have been customized to work for a specific mod, and the team has created and published an EXE version of the app. There is no EXE for this base version of the app.*

Download the setup exe from the latest release and run it. Follow the installation prompts. You can save a shortcut to your desktop or run it from your Start menu like any other Windows application. 

NOTE: You will most likely be warned by Windows Defender about malware for two reasons: 1) the program used to convert the Python app to an EXE is commonly used by hackers, so Windows (as it should) flags these as potential risks, especially because 2) I created the app without a proper developers license (because it costs hundreds of dollars per year). So, if you're not comfortable installing and running the EXE, that's understandable. You can always run the Python source file directly as described in Option 2 below. And feel free to inspect the source code (or ask a programmer you trust to inspect it) beforehand. 

### Install Option 2: Python Source (required for Mac and Linux) <a name="installation--python"></a>

Alternatively, if you have Python installed on your machine, you can run the source py file instead of installing an EXE. If you're on a Mac or Linux machine, this is the only way to run the program.

**STEP 1 – INSTALL PYTHON AND REQUIRED MODULES**

First, check to see if Python is already installed with `python --version`. Also try `python3 --version` if the first one doesn't return a version number. If neither command shows you have Python, you'll need to install it. The easiest way is to go to [python.org](https://www.python.org) and download and install it from there. This project was created in Python Version 3.11.7, so it's best to use that version, if possible. If you have no plans to do anything else in or with Python, this is fine. However, the recommended way to use Python is through "virtual environemnts". Think of them as seperate sandboxes in which you can install specific versions of Python and the specific modules (and versions of the modules) required for a particular application. The easiest way to get started with virtual environments is to use a free program called Anaconda ([anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)).

Next, you need to install the project's required modules. This is done with the "pip" installer command. All of the project's required modules are listed in the included requirements.txt file. So, to install them all at once, simply open your Terminal or Command Prompt window, navigate to the project directory where the requirements.txt file resides, and run the command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**STEP 2 – RUN THE PY FILE**

With python and all of the required modules installed, you can now start the app with:

    python Textures-Downloader.py

or if that doesn't work, try...

    python3 Textures-Downloader.py

The app should open in a new window and from here it will work just the same as running the EXE.

Closing the window or pressing Ctrl + c will terminate the app.

## Using the App <a name="usage"></a>

### INITIAL CONFIGURATION <a name="usage--config"></a>

**GitHub API Token**

A GitHub "Personal Access Token" is required for all users. A free Github account is required and the API token can be found in Settings (get to this by clicking your user avatar in the top right corner) > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens. Either token options are suitable, and the token needs no permissions. Simply click through the options, give it any name you like, give it the 1 year maximum expiration (or whatever you like), and click Generate Token. Copy and save the token somewhere safe. Don't share it.

When the app opens the first time, it should open to the "First Time Setup" screen. Paste your token into the GitHub Personal Access Token field. Click Save Configuration.

**Defining the Path to the Textures Folder**

In the "Full Path to Textures Folder", paste the path to your emulator's `textures` folder. It should look something like `C:\PCSX2\textures`. It's recommended you copy this directly from your PCSX2 settings at Settings > Graphics > Texture Replacements. Click Save Configuration.

### FIRST TIME SETUP/INSTALLATION OF THE MOD <a name="usage--setup"></a>

With your configuration options defined, you can now run the initial download and installation of the textures pack by clicking the "Begin Installation" button. Depending on the size of the texture pack, your internet speed, and the current health of the Github API CDN, this could take up to several hours. For 10 GBs, a time of 2-3 hours is normal. Fortunately, you can leave the app running in the background and let it do its thing. Do not close the app or the download will terminate with no option to continue where it left off.

The app breaks up the download into smaller zip files, which reduces the frequency of failed downloads and corrupted zip files. Upon completion of every zip file, the zip is extracted and then deleted. When all zips are done downloading and extracting, the tool re-organizes the folder to ensure the textures are in the proper location (assuming you defined the path to your textures folder correctly) – `C:\PCSX2\textures\SLUS-21214\replacements`.

### UPDATING AND SYNCING WITH THE MOD <a name="usage--sync"></a>

The next time you open the app, it will open to the "Textures Updater" screen. 

Click "Run Sync" and the app will look at every change made to the project Github repo in the time period specified and ensure your local directory is in sync with these changes by downloading files, renaming/moving files, or deleting files. If you chose "Download New Content", the time period will be between your last sync date and now. This is usually very quick. If you chose "Full Sync", it will look at every change ever made to the Github repo. Depending on the age of the repo, it could take several minutes, but it shouldn't take hours. It's recommended to do a Full Sync after the initial installation, occassionally moving forward, and whenever you experience issues with textures not working. 

At the end of every sync, the last run date is updated, and a health check is done (the entire folder and files structure is compared to that of the Github repo).

Users should run a sync when the mod team has announced that new content has been published (aka pushed to the Github repo's main branch).

If you use **custom textures**, be sure to keep all of those in a `user-customs` folder in the root of replacements, and remember to disable the default textures by prepending the filename with a dash, and leave them in their place.
